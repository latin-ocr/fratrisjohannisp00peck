superseded by a new and ‘ Eternal Gospel '3 propter quod
timendum est de subversione ecclesiae} .

William of St. Amour made great play with this in his trea-
tise “De periculis novissimorum temporum '³ (1255), and the
controversy extended far outside the limits of the University
question. William was led on to deny the ‘ plenitudo potestatis '
of the papacy, and brought on himself and his writings a far
severer condemnation (5th Oct. 1256)2 than that pronounced
on the Introductorz'us of F riar Gerard (23rd Oct. 12 55).3 William
was banished from France by order of Alexander IV„ and
retired to his birthplace‚ St. Amour, in the county of Burgundy.

Many controversial treatises were issued on either side.

Those of the Mendicants are better known than those of their ,

opponents. Misfortune has followed the works of William of St.
Amour. An edition of his writings published in 16324 was
promptly suppressed. The most accessible edition of the De
periculis is that by Edward Brown in the Fasciculus Rerum Ex-
petendarum, vol. ii„ where it appears under the misleading title
“ Scriptum Scholae Parisiensis de periculis Ecclesiae compositum
anno 1389 ''. In the same volume are two sermons by William
bearing on the controversy. His reply to Bonaventura's Quaes-
tio disputata de paupertate is printed in the introduction to the
fifth volume of the Quaracchi edition of St. Bonaventura's
workS. Of another writer who is said to have fiourished at
this time, Laurentius Anglicus, nothing is known except the
titles of two works mentioned by Bale—Contm pseudo-prae-
dicatores, and Defen502·z'u7n Gulz‘elmi.⁵ That popular songs
played a considerable part in the controversy is clear from
a bull of Alexander IV. (24th Sept. 1259) denouncing cer-
tain “ rismos et cantilenas de novo ut dicitur indecenter
compositas'’:6 and it is probable that at this time Rutebeuf
was already issuing his series of satires against the Mendicant
