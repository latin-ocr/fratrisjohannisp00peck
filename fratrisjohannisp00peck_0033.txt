TRACTATUS PAUPERIS 15

friarS. 1 Jean Clopinel de Meung, who put into verse the
arguments of William of St. Amour in the second part of
the “Roman de la Rose,'' wrote apparently a few years
later.2

On the other side we have St. Thomas Aquinas “ Contra
impugnantes Dei cultum et relzgz'onem,’' which probably contains
the arguments used by his master Albertus Magnus in the
disputation at Anagni against William of St. Amour ; St.
Bonaventura’s Quaestio disputata depaupertate; and the anony-
mous Minorite treatise beginning “ Manus quae contra omnipo-
tentem e1·igitur‚'’ which is generally attributed to Bertrand of
Bayonne but sometimes to Thomas of York‚ lector to the Francis-
cans at Oxford :this exists in several MSS. but has not yet been
printed. Itis not clear whether it was written at this time or
some years later.3

The success of the mendicants at this period both in their
quarrel with the University and in their controversy with the
secular clergy generally must be attributed largely to the vigor-
ous support which they received from Alexander IV. The
Pope on the one hand, at the very beginning of his pontificate‚
revoked the bull Etsi animarum (21st Nov. 12 54), by which
innocent IV. had attempted, in the interests of the bishops and
parish priests, to limit the privileges of the friars with regard
to preaching and hearing confessions34 and on the other hand
by the bull Quasi [tgmtm vitae⁵ <14th April, 125 5), decided all
the questions at issue between the University and the friars in
favour of the latter.

The second period begins after the accession of Clement IV.
(1265). To him William of St. Amour sent his Liber de anti-
