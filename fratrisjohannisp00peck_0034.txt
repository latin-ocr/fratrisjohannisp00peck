christo et eiusdem ministris which he wrote during his exile. 1
It closely resembles the De periculis, including a denunciation
of the ‘Eternal Gospel,' and has been printed in vol. ix. of
Martene and Durand⁷s Amplissima Collectio under the title
“ Liber Magistri Nicolai Oresme episcopi'’.2 There seems to
have been no direct reply to this treatise. But about the
same time Gerard of Abbeville, Archdeacon of PonthieU, a sup-
porter of W. de St. Amour, published a reply to the Manus
qaae contra Omnipotentem, under the title Contra adversariam
peifectionis Christianae et praelatorum et facultatum ecclesiae, the
opening words of which were: “Tantum sibi praesumtionis as-
sumserunt quidam homines ⁷². To this treatise, which is pre-
served in MS. in the Vatican‚3 Bonaventura replied in vhis
Apologia pauperum contra calumniatorem written about 1269*
1270. To the same period we may perhaps assign the treatises
of Thomas Aquinas, De perfectione vitae spritualis and Contra
pestiferam doctrinam retralientz‘mn liomines a religionis ingressu
(or Contra retrahentes), and also Pecham’s T ractatas Pauperis
contra insipientem novellarum lieresnm confictorem circa evange-
licam paupertatem, or Liber a⁷e perfectione evangeli'ca.4

Another work on the side of the Seculars (also preserved in
manuscript) was that by N icholaS, Treasurer of Lisieux‚ De per-
fectione et excellentia clericormn, in which he replied to the De
perfectione vitae spiritualis of St. Thomas. It can hardly have
been composed later than 1270, as the author sent not only this
treatise, but also one written subsequently, to William of St.
Amour, who died in 1272.5

Can we among these writings identify the “ three books in

2 The editors have probably confused Nic. Oresme, Bishop of Lisieux‚ 1377-

1382, with Nicholas, Treasurer of LisieuX, a strong supportet of W. de St. Amour
The work, however, bears all the marks of William's authorship. Cf. Hist. La.
France, xxi. p. 468 seq.
