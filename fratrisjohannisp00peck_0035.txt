TRACTATUS PAUPERIS 17

one volume⁷' in answer to which Pecham wrote the T metatus
Pauperis ‚9 “ Ι have recently,'' he says in the prologue, “ lighted
on three books of an unknown author in one volume setting
forth a new kind of doctrine, namely that riches and pleasures
and glory are confined to the use of the perfect alone, like three
unclean spirits vilely croaking (after the manner of frogs) what
they could not prove. Their materia is the lying defamation
of the good, their forma misleading quotations from the saints
and an utterly ridiculous concatenation not of reasons but of
ravingS, their causa afficiens the presumptuous invention of
fatuous novelty, their causa finalis the overthrow and degrada-
tion of that most high and most strict poverty which Christ has
consecrated. Verily this empty and childish doctrine, whose
headless beginning leads through a putrid middle to a disastrous
end, is unworthy of a written refutation; but lest the wings of
the simple be caught by these silly snares, Ι will endeavour by
the everlasting testimonies of truth to destroy the pestiferous
teaching, but Ι shall not, when using the authority of the saintS,
misapply or mutilate quotations, or continue them in my own
words to suit my own views in such a way that it cannot be de-
cided what is authentic and what is added, as fraudulent men do
in order to make their lying comments seem part of the truth.'’

Denifle states that the book thus denounced was the Contra
adversarium of Gerard of Abbeville, which he calls ‘opus
tripartitum '.1 He applieS, however, the same description ‘opus
tripartitum‚’ to the De perfectione of Nicholas of Lisieux ; 2 and it
may be noticed that N icholas certainly replied to Pecham's
T metatus Paupem·s.2 Ι have not had an opportunity of ex-
amining either of these works‚ and therefore cannot attempt to
decide the question. It seems clear that Pecham did not
deal merely with the arguments of an individual, but with those
of the secular party generally. There is obviously a very close
connection between his treatise and the treatise in five books
printed among the works of William of St. Amour under the
title of Collectz‘ones scripturae sacrae (inc. “Sapientiam anti-
