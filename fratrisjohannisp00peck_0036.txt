quorum”.) 1 It seems doubtful whether William was the author,
(there is for instance no reference in the collectiones to the*
‘ Eternal Gospel ') but it wasvcertainly composed byavery able
controversialist of the same school. A few definite instances
will show the connection between the T metatus Pauperis and
the Collectz'oneS. Both refer to the prophecies of Hildegarde
and St. Bernard’s interest in them ;2 both discuss the garments
worn by St. Bartholomew in India; 3 and the fifty ‘signs' by
which pseudo-preachers may be known, as quoted by Pecham
in his last chapter, are, in substance, order and almost in the
very words used, identical with the fifty ‘signs’ given in the
fourth ‘ Distinctio ' of the Collectz‘oneS.

Very little can be inferred from the T metatus Pauperis
itself as to the time and circumstances of its origin. The
following passage 4 refers to the condemnation and punishment
of William of St. Amour: ‘⁶ Some, whose heresies the apostolic
see condemned, were accused by the friars before that see,
which justly deprived them of their ecclesiastica] benefices, and
caused some of them to be banished from the kingdom of
France: but they were treated mercifully, since the same fire
did not devour them and their heresies ’'. Again Pecham
declares that those who impiously condemn the state of poverty
should be treated as heretics “as was partly done in the time of
Alexander IV.'’ 5 In the only passage which can be called
autobiographical‚ he mentions having seen the Holy Coat of
Argenteuil, and says :6 “The statement of some people that
the coat was purple and is preserved in the Sancta Sanctorum
at Rome, Ι do not easily believe ”. He was probably not yet
“lector Sacri Palatii ’'. We shall not be sar wrong if we put
the composition of the work at about 1270. Pecham in the
Tractatus Pauperis does not, 1 think, quote from the writings

1 Opera Ommia (1632) p. ,ΙΙΙ-475. The author says (p. 126) : ‘⁴ Noli etiam,

lector pie, de authore seu potius compilatore huius libelli, sicut nec de calamo
quo scriptus est, curiose inquirere: sed attende authoritates Sanctorum in eo

contentas ''. Denifle, Chart. p. 459, says it is anonymous in MSS. of the 13th
and 14th centuries. (1 may note that the “ Manus quae contra Omnipotentem ’'
is referred to on p. 190). “
