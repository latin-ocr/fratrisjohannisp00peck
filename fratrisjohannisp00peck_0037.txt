TRACTATUS PAUPERIS 19

of contemporary friars, as he quotes from Bonaventura's Apologia
Pauperum and Exposz'tz'o Super Regulam F flatrum stffinorum
in the Canticum Pauperis pro Dilecta. His treatise has in form
and method more affinities to the works of Aquinas on the
same subject than to those of Bonaventura, and perhaps the
chief interest of it lies in the detailed and apparently honest
statement of the arguments of his opponentS. He sometimes
admits that the F ranciscans of his time did not live up to their
profession, as in his denunciation of the great buildings of the
friars as “ monstra '’.1 Nor are flashes of real eloquence altogether
absent, such as the passage in which he claims that the friars are
not gyrovagi but “the wheels of the Lord's chariot''.‘-' Two
omissions of importance may be noticed3 there is no direct
reference to the disputes in the University of PariS, and no
reference at all to the Joachimite controversy.

Of the mactatus Pauperis Ι have printed in full the pro-
logue, Chapter X. and Chapter XVI. Chapter X. contains
Pecham’s exposition of the Franciscan rule and has already
been printed in the Fz'mrzamentum Trium Ordimmn (Paris
1512, and Venice 1513). Chapter XVI. may be compared
with the last chapter of Williarn of St. Amour's Depericulz’s, as
well as with the fourth book of the Collectz'ones Scrz'ptzcrae Sacrae.
The early chapters of the T metatus (L-VI.) consisting mostly
of quotations from the F athers and not very illuminating
generalitieS, have been omitted, as has also the very short
Chapter XIII. which in the Oxford MS. occupies only half a
page. Of the remaining chapters short extracts have been
selected. The extracts are intended to illustrate the attitude of
Pecham and his adversaries, and to include the scanty autobio-

graphical and historical allusions in the treatise‚ and the definite
references to St. Francis and his Order.
