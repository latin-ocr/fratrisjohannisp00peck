I have used O. as the basis of this edition and have collated
B. and V} In the extracts and in Chapter XVI. Ι have only
noted various readings where they appeared intrinsically im-
portant. In Chapter X. I have noted all the various readings of
these three MSS. (except variations in spelling and in the
order of words), and have alsQ with the kind help of Father
Michael Bihl O.F.M., collated the printed edition in the Firma-
mentum T rium Ordz'uum, Paris Ι 512, referred to in the notes as
F. (The version in the Venice edition of the Firmamentum
Trium Ordz‘uum waS‚ so far as I examined it, a reprint of the
Paris edition.)

On special points Ι have consulted two later MSS„ namely
Laurentiana Ex Bibl. S. CruciS, xxxi. sin. 3 at F lorence‚ and
Add. 36984 in the British Museum (saec xiV. ex.)v: these are
referred to as L. and M. respectively.

I desire to express my thanks to the President and F ellows
of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, for allowing me to have their
MS. of the T ructatus Pauperis rotographed; to Mr. Kingsford
for transcribing Chapter XI. from the rotograph, and to F ather

1 I have not collated V. for the extracts of Cap. VII. and V111.‚ and have, so
far as Icould, supplied the omission by collating M. (= Brit. Mus. Add. 36984).
