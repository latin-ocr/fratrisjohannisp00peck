clasped hands he exclaimed: “l would, brother Francis, that
thy order and mine might be one and that we might live in the
Church under the same rule”. This account is substantially
reproduced in the second life of CelanO, who of the one chapter
makes tw0‚ interpolating in the middle the strongest censure of
the divisions between the two orders.1 Quid dicitis filz'z‘ sanct-

orum ,Ρ Invicem mordet& et comeditis, nec bella et lites nisiex -

conczfflzkcentz‘z‘s oriuntur. This bitter reproof shows that at the
time Celano was writing, that is to say about 1246, hatred was
already alive and the degenerate sons of the loving patriarchs
invidia pleni graves sunt invicem ad vz'dendmn. And we might
*argue from this, as Sabatier has rightly pointed out, that the
Speculum, in which these reproofs do not occur, must have
been composed before these struggles arose.

Perhaps the details of the Speculum may notbe all exact.
It is indeed hard to realise that, during the lifetime of St.
Francis, the Bishop of Ostia should have thought of introduc-
ing into the mendicant orders those promotions to the prelacy
which were to widen still further the breach between the mode-
rates and the zelantz'‚· it is more difficult to understand his com-
placency towards the refusal of brother Dominic and brother
Francis ; but it is the historical fact, that the Dominican order
modelled itself on the F ranciscan, when the institution of

, poverty seemed likely to prove a powerful force to increase the

influence of the order.

Another proof of the intimacy between the F ranciscans and
Dominicans may be drawn from the Chronica Trz'bulat2·0num,2
where, deviating from the Speculum and Celano ii„ it relates
that St. F ranciS‚ indignant at the erection of a minorite convent
within the city of Bologna‚ would on no account set foot therein,
but instead sought hospitality from the Dominican brethren,
and it was only upon the intercession of one of their number, a
famous preacher, that he consented later to repair for awhile to
