CONTRA KILWARDBY 93

The version of Claren0‚ differing from that of the two other

authorities, is certainly drawn from ancient documents 3 these
documents implied also the existence of a recognised school
in the convent of Bologna‚ associating with it the name of the
canonist brother Peter Stacia‚ who doubtless had taught there.

But these documents have disappeared only too completely,
and not until new discoveries have been made shall we know

how trustworthy they are, and why the information given by
them is lacking in the Speculum and in the second life of
CelanO.

This is, however, beyond doubt, that at the time of the
furious attack of William of St. Amour on the mendicant

lowerS, against the looser interpretatioins of the Dominicans,
Nor was Pecham among the most ardent zelanti, but as a

reproduced textually in the vigorous reply of Pecham. This
treatise cannot have been written later than 1272 because in
that year Kilwardby, who from 1261 had been provincial of the
Dominicans in England, was raised by Gregory X. to the arch-
bishopric of Canterbury. Pecham had been without doubt
brought into personal relations with his contemparary, and even
now when he combats him and sometimes hits him shrewdly, he
always calls him ‘carissime'. Perhaps they may have been
