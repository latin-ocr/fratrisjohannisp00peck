together at the University of Paris where both taught in the
schools and wrote several treatises and commentarieS.
Kilwardby first won his fame by his lectures on logie and
grammar, but after his subsequent entry into the Dominican
order he devoted himself to the study of theology, and St.
Augustine was his favourite author, whose works he divided

into chapterS, prefixing to each a summary of the contents.1
The libraries ,of F lorence possess but very few of the
writings of Kilwardby. The Laurentian library possesses in
Codex lxxi. 29 a commentary on the first Analytics, entitled
Quaestiones snper prologum which ends thus . . . Explicnnt
notnle libri priorum Α ristotelz's tradite a magistro Roberto
anglico de K ilwirbi (which seems to be corrected from Kilwirni).
Another copy of the same treatise is preserved in a MS. of
S. Maroe, which was numbered 107, and is now in the N ational
Library of Florence (conv. sopp. i. 10. 48). On the fiy-leaf are
the words, De incoationefomnarnm secundum JW. L. de U tino et
Albertns de Saxonia snper l. Ι priorum. Albertns de Saxonia is
a mistake, since in the Explicit it is clearly stated, Explicinnt
notnle priora 777 analiticornm fratris Roberti, <fratris Roberti,
in another hand). It is in fact the same treatise as that con-
tained in the Codex Laur. lxxi. 29 which begins: Cmn omnis
scientia sit veri inquisitiva et leaeo est per rationein et moduni
veri differendi, loyca antem lmbet niodum inquirendi veritatem in
aliis scientiis detemninate, patet qnod loyca rationem et niodum
diserendi debet determinare, sed ratio discendi secundum Boethium
duas partes habet, scilicet inventionem et* judicium, ergo loyca de
utraque habet determinare, nt dicatur quedam pars loyce de arte

inveniendi et quedam de arte judicandi.

In the Laurentian Codex S. Croce Plut. xxix, Dextr. 12, Ἴ

relying on Bandini's description, I tried to find a commentary
on the fourth book de Coel0, which Robert was said to have
written in continuation of the Commentary of St. Thomas
Aquinas on the first books, It did indeed seem strange to me
that Friar Robert should appear as the commentator, not as— .
hitherto on the logical works of Aristode, but on his physic5,
