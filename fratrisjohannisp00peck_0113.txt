CONTRA KILWARDBY 95

and that he should have been transformed from the opponent
>of St. Thomas into the continuer of his work. But this would
have increased the interest of the commentary, if I had not
soon become aware that Bandini had fallen into error, misled
by the Explicit of the MS„ which is written in another hand
>and reads: Explicit sententia Roberti saper quartam de Coelo.
This annotation is a complete mistake‚ since the Commentary
is not only on the fourth book de Coel0, but upon the third
as well as the fourth, and is not the work of Robert, but, as
the MS. itself says of Peter of Auvergne. On the same
fly-leaf one reads: Liber conventas Sancte Crucis de Florentia
ordim’s minorum. Sanctus T homas cle Aquino de celo et mando
et M agister Petras de Alvernia saper metaphisicam Aristotelis,
“ Super metaplizlcicam'' is a mistake, but the rest of the de-
scription is correct. The MS. begins with the commentary on
the first book of the de Coelo in these words: “Sicut philo-
sophus-dicit in primo phisicorum ’'. At the end of the second
book (fol. 38) we read: Explicit sententia fratris Thome super
secundam libram dc celo et mando, Deo gratias. Then follow
the commentaries on the third book (beginningz “Et primo
quid igitur de ceIO, etc, Postquam philosophus conplevit con-
siderationem de corporibus simplicibus ''), and on the fourth
book (beginning, fol. 48V : “De gravi autem et levi, etc, Cum
intentio philosophi esset in libro precedenti.'') This ends on
fol. 5 5 with the note, which escaped Bandini: In lioc completur
expositio magistri Petri de Alvernia in tertiam et quartum coeli
et mundi Aristotelis, abi preventus morte venerabilis vir frater
Thomas de Aquino omisit, in qua quamvis non assequatur in-
tentionem ipsius, aliqualis erit via aliis assequendi ipsam vel
simpliciter vel inparte. This statement is clear, and contradicts
the note in another hand which attributes this commentary to
Robert. Then follows another commentary ending fol. 121
with the words: Explicit sententia magistri Petri de Alvernia
saper librum metkeororum Aristotelis. This Explicit explains
the erroneous indication of the fly-leaf quoted above, where
metaphysicam has been substituted for metheororum.

So this commentary of Kilwardby on the fourth book of
de Coelo disappearS‚ and similarly the Quaestiones aliquot
