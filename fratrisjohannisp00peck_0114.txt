conv. soppr. i. iv. 20, formerly No 445 in the convent of
S. MarCO, must be attributed to Robert Holcoth, not to Robert
Kilwardby. Of the other far more important writings of
Kilwardby, such as the Commentary on Avicenna and the book Δ μ
De Ortu Scieni‘iai‘mn, there is no trace in the F lorentine
librarieS.

Pecham also was a master who taught With success in the
University of PariS, and appears to have applied his mind rather
to physics and metaphysics than to logical and grammatical
exerciseS. The catalogue of his works has been given by

Kingsford in his admirable monograph on Pecham in the- 1

Dictionary of N aliona! Biogmphy, vol. xliv. pp. 190-97 and even

difficultate el brevitate et in quibusdam falsitate, simplicioribusy
quibus intendo servire inutilia. And this object, of treating
astronomy not fundamentally‚ but so far as it might serve for
the interpretation of the Scriptures, and of treating it in a clear
and elementary form, adapted to beginner5‚ he summarises at
the close thus : Haec simplicibus scripsi coactus paracz'or obtem-
perare caritati superne, dando parum quod liabeo, quam magnum
aliquid derogasse videri simplicibus tamen scripsi non iiiey‘m‘ibus,
ab eis veniam peteris Si‘cubi defeci (fol. 132V). In other words
Pecham's compendium was fitted to supersede the treatise of
Sacrobosc0, presenting the same teaching in an easy and more
elementary form. But if we may argue from the number of
the MSS„ the result was not attained, and Sacrobosco continued .
