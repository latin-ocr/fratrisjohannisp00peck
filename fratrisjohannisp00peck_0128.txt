ac munditia Platonicis, in asperitate Academicis, in incessabili
inquisitione sapientiae Peripateticis.

These resemblanceS, which the author discovers between
the new religious society and the ancient schools of philosophy,
are most interesting, not because the comparisons are happy or
well-founded, but because they show how, under the habit of
the friar, always survive the memories of the student and of the
master of the University of Paris, The rest of the work deals
with the difficulties which the novice raises about the F ranciscan
Rule, before he decides to embrace it. The difficulties are all
easily solved for him by the ‘ Senior‚’ who is Pecham's master,

St. Bonaventura.
The novice asks: cum episcopi succedant apostolis, quomodo

licet eis habere pecuniam aurumque et argentum, si hoc apostolis
non licebat? He does not have to wait for the answer: illam
paupertatis et asperitatis districtionem non fuisse impositam
apostolis ut praelatis, sed ut fundatoribus ecclesiae generalis '’.
(pp. 151, 152). The novice urges that this rule of absolute
poverty, this renunciation of property even in common, seems a
daring innovation, and the master answers: Non est nova sed
renovata ,· superius enim est tibi multipliciter declaratum lianc
fuisse vitam apostolorum et ante pro parte gentilium pbilosophorum,
iterum etiam sanctissimorum olim monachorum (p. 181). Other
reasons for doubt the novice finds in this, that while he feels
more drawn to preaching than to anything else, this office, which
accords so ill with the severity of their life, does not seem in
harmony with the calling of the brothers minor. But the
‘Senior' resolutely affirms that none are better qualified to
preach than the Minorite brethren: cum autem vita ipsorum
sit vitae apostolorum, principalium scilicet predicatorum, simil-
lima, nullis magis quam ipsis competit predicare (p. Ι 88).

Some of these ideas are to be found in the controversial
work written by Pecham against the Dominican father Kil-
wardby‚ which I publish from the two MSS. in the Laurentian
library already mentioned, the first (A) S. Croce xxxvi. dextr. Α

12, the more difficult to read but the more complete, the second
(Β) S. Croce xv. dextr. 12 ; both are of the XIV. century. In

the first MS.the work was transcribed in 1391 by a brother
