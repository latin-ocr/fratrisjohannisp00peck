CONTRA KILWARDBY 1 1 1

Antonio Aulesa, who extended the abbreviation ‘Ro ’ into
Rogeruan instead of into Robertmn, to which it is corrected in
the incipit of the MS. In the title in MS. B. (fol. 146)—
Responsiones . . . ad epistolam missam . . . a quodam fratre
Roberto de ordine ipso predicatorum—the name is right as far as
it goes, but it is evident that the scribe did not succeed in
identifying “brother Robert‚'’ who was not a nonentity‚ but a
magister who became prior of the province of England,
Archbishop of Canterbury, where he was Pecham’s immediate
predecessor, and finally Cardinal of Porto,

The Dominican‚ in a letter to the novices exalting that
order which they were preparing to enter, quoted the
prophecies of Hildegarde and Joachim, according to which the
Virgin herself had prayed earnestly for the institution of the
brotherhood. The F ranciscan in his turn was able to answer‚
that in any case the Minorites could invoke this prophetic litera-
ture no less than their rivals, indeed perhaps with more right
than they. But the wary controversialist does not allow him-
self to wander on this perilous road. He knows how much
modern imposture passes itself off for ancient prophecy, sanc-
torum siquidem revelationes autenticas novimus, apocriphas non
curamus. It is not unknown to him qnid scripserit Hildegarde
qnid joachim divinaverit, but he counsels great caution and
careful sifting of the good from the bad, sed probandos scio esse
spiritus, quia multos errare fecerunt sompnia. The tempest raised
by the pseudo-Joachimitic literature was certainly raging at a
time not far distant from that in which this answer was written.

Continuing to extol his order Kilwardby calls it the order
which most closely resembles the apostles; for the apostolic
office was to preach the gospel‚ and no other can fulfil this task
with so much zeal as the order which has chosen the very name
of preachers Ah! replies the Minorite, you are the apostles
who preach again the good new5‚ but you do not renounce gold
and silver nor go all over the world barefoot‚ as the preachers
of the new saith did. The gospel also speaks of false prophets
and false miracle-workers whom the Lord will deny in the
great day of Judgment. This ought we equally to fear, both
you and Ι, et hoc minz· et tibi pariter fhrrnidandmn.
