1 12 PECHAM

Another advantage the Dominican claimed for his brethren
was that, with them, preaching was not merely an ad junct to·
another office, but the principal and essential office of the fra-
ternity, from which its name, Fratres de ordine praedicatorum,
was derived. But how is that? asks Pecham; just because our
order through humility calls itself “the Minorite,'’ should it not
have preaching for its function quite as much aS, if not more
than, the Dominican order? John the Baptist, though he
disclaimed the name of prophet and of Elias, was always
the herald of the Redemption. ln fine, the office of preaching
belongs properly to no one but to the bishops, and only by
delegation of the bishops have the Dominicans the faculty to
preach‚ not because they enjoy any greater prerogative than is >
possessed by the MinoriteS.

More bitter and more direct now become the invectives of ⁷

Kilwardby against the FranciscanS, and more cutting and con-
temptuous the retorts of Pecham. According to the Dominican,
the brethren who go barefoot are not the best adapted for
apostolic pilgrimages—-in winter, on account of severe suffering,
in summer, on the contrary, because they enjoy the comfort of
going unshod, and during all seasonS, because they do not shun
delicate food. This is slander against brotherly charity, replies
the Franciscan; no winter has ever prevented the barefoot
brothers from making long journeys among the TartarS, Greeks
and Saracen5‚ and the hot soil makes the going barefoot in
summer as great a sacrifice as it is in winter 3 but the sons of
St. Francis are well accustomed to make sacrificeS, and it is
wicked to accuse them of that wherein they only follow the
precept of the gospel, ‘eat that which is set before you '.

The most important part of the work is the controversy
concerning poverty. Here it is seen that the Dominican
brethren‚ who at one time were no less strict than the Francis-
can in calling themselves mendicants‚ now on the contrary hold
quite different opinions from their rivals on the subject of
poverty‚ and Kilwardby‚ like St. ThomaS, sets no great value
on it : he does not hesitate to declare that his order did not be:
lieve they were departing from the example of Jesus and of his
apostles‚ who disdained not to carry in their purses as much
