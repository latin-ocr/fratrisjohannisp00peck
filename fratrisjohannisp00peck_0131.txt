CONTRA KILWARDBY 113

money as they might need to buy food. And in the same
way the Dominicans do not depart from the Gospel teaching if
they provide for their maintenance‚ and if they possess houses
and gardens and schools according to their need. At the same
time they do not mean that everybody else should follow their
example, nor do they condemn those who endeavour to re-
nounce all possessionS, even in common, and refuse to receive
money in any form. Only let it not be said, when the Minorites
accept not only provisions of corn and oil, but what is more,
also testamentary legacies, that they are keeping strictly to the
law of poverty‚ when really they are availing themselves of the
interposita persona, as a convenient means for acquiring the use
oi what they need—not the temporary but the permanent use,
which is equivalent to property.

To these objectionS, which are partly given word for word
and partly can be easily reconstructed from the replieS, Pecham
opposes a long series of arguments, founded not only on the
text of the Scriptures and of the writings of the FatherS, but
also on the decretals and pandectS, as we shall see the theolo-
gians and canonists doing many years later, when invited by
John XXII. to give their opinion on the same question. Pecham
acknowledges that some texts in the Gospels imply that the
apostles carried money in their purses; but the apostle who
carried the purse was just the one who robbed and betrayed his
Master, which furnishes the useful moral, that, even when carried
for the use of a community, money always presents incitements
and temptations to wrong doing. And in any case, Jesus did not
carry either gold or silver‚ since among the crowd which accom-
panied him there were persons able to relieve, not only his needS‚
but those of the whole community, and he spoke explicitly
of not possessing any money, even for the payment of taxes to
public officials ; he recommended‚ nay enjoined, his disciples to
take no money when they went into all the world to spread the
good news If ever Jesus seems to have permitted the buying
‘of anything‚ it was precisely at the Passover, when the great perse-
cution was near at hand and the apostles would no longer have
found anyone to supply their needs, For the rest, Pecham

belonged to the moderate party, gpr “ centre,'' which kept equally
