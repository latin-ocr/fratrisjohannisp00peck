distant from extreme opinions. And though sor his own part
he may think that the true law of the Gospel enjoins absolute
poverty and that Jesus and his apostles conformed to this, yet
he can make such distinctions as uphold and justify the exist-
ing property of the secular or even of the regular clergy. For
at the time of the apostleS, he sayS, the priesthood was not yet
instituted, and not all those who follow the apostles have the
obligation and the ability to fulfil the same dutieS. There are
then in the Church divers functionS, nor canit be supposed that
those, who, like the bishopS, have to provide for the good of the
flock intrusted to thern, should be without the necessary meanS.
Therefore neither bishops nor popes should be condemned for
possessing property, and for the same reason no other order can
be precluded from holding possessionS. But this does not
mean, that the true law of Christ is not absolute poverty and
does not proscribe property of every kind, whether private or
in common. Nor ought it to be denied that the MinoriteS, in
embracing that law, seek to conform to evangelical perfection.
And if the necessities of life have imposed on them some com-
promiseS, as that of making use of the interposita persona to
<collect the offerings of the faithful, they should not be re-
proached for this, as ‘il carissimo' has reproached thern in his
covert attacks, For, in the first place, these compromises were
suggested and sanctioned by Pope Gregory IX. himself and
were explicitly declared by him to have been in accordance
with the intention of the Patriarch Francis; and in the second
place these modifications have not the importance which F riar
Robert wishes to attach to them 3 for the property always re-
sides in the giver and if· it should pass through a hundred hands
he could always recall it whenever he chose.

In the last part of the work, apart from the personal ac-
cusations which the opponents exchange, each in turn reproach-
ing the other for lack of charity to his neighbour and for
exalting his own order to the detriment of the other—two
points deserve to be noticed. The first, which was afterwards
fully discussed in the time of John XXII„ concerns the things
which are consumed by being used, in which it seems the use
cannot be separated from the property. I do not know if the
