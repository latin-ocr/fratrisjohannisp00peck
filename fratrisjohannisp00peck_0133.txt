CONTRA KILWARDBY 115

argument had been formulated for the first time by Master
Robert Kilwardby‚ nor does Pecham report his wordS, but con-
tents himself with opposing briefly to him that the property in
the livery which the servant wearS, belongs always to his mas-
ter, although the livery wears out with use.

The other point refers to a doctrine expounded in the
Summa of St. ThomaS‚ which Kilwardby either repeats here
or teaches for the first time, namely‚ that in the matter ofriches
one need not pay attention to the thing, but to the mind of
him who makes use of them. So that he who has no attach-
ment to the things which he possesseS, and who can throw them
overboard with the greatest readiness when necessary, may be
called just as much a stranger to riches as the man who pos-

sesses nothing. Poverty, replies Pecham, if from one point of ’

view it has to be put among those things which can be either
good or bad according as one knows or does not know how to
use them, from another cannot be held as indifferent, having
for the Christian an intrinsic value ; otherwise Jesus would not
have rigorously prescribed it to his apostles. Taken together
the work of Pecham and the preceding one of Killwardby can
be considered as the first skirmishes in that war between the
two orders which henceforth was to be continuous and which
at the time of John XXII. broke out with greater violence when
the inquisitor of Narbonne, the Dominican John de Belma‚
condemned a beguin and a Franciscan lecturer, Brother
Berengarius Taloni, for having maintained that “Christ and
His apostles in following the way of perfection had nothing by
right of property or lordship either in special or in common.’' 1

Coming back to the controversy of Pecham against Kil-
wardby‚ I feel bound to add, that if the two opponents strongly
disagreed upon the value of their respective orders and upon
xthe way to understand and practise poverty‚ they were yet
quite in accord on philosophical questionS‚ since they both be-
longed to that Augustinian school which used all its strength
to oppose step by step the advance of the Aristotelian flood.
The principal argument which in his Commentary on the book
of the Sentences Pecham adduces of the existence of God, he
