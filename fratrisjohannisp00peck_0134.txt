draws, following St. Augustine‚ from the presence in our mind of
immutable truth, such as scientific axioms and the moral
law. These principleS, superior to our mind, are like a light
which illuminates it, without which it could not distinguish the
true from the false, the good from the bad. This light is no
other than God. Si lamen illud est supra mentes nostras, non
nisi Deus est} From Ξῖ. Augustine and from St. Anselrn alike
he borrows the doctrine that God is the absolute good, without
which not even the relative good can be understood, since the
absolute good est essentialiter bonum, cuias participatione cae-
tera sunt homst 11· not from Ξῖ. Augustine‚ from a follower of
St. Augustine like St. Anselm, he draws the famous argument:
S i Deus est qao magis cogitari non potest, necessarium est Deum
esse.3 And subsequently he soars still higher—to the Neo-
platonist Pseudo-Dionysius, who suggests to him the doctrine
of the ineffability of the supreme principle: Propterea Diony-
sius dicit Deum superdeum et superbonum, qaia omne nomen
significat mentis conceptum.4

No less determined a follower of Ξῖ. Augustine than Pecham
is Kilwardby‚ who was Pecham's predecessor in the archbishop-
ric of Canterbury. He does not differ from his contemporary in
holding Aristotle as the philosopher par excellence, and he
also makes the text of Aristotle the basis of his teaching. But
if he attaches very great importance to the logical and rhetorical
workS, he ranks less high the works on physics and meta-
physic5‚ and some doctrines which many of his contemporaries
drew from them, he considered so dangerous that he pro-
hibited the teaching of them henceforth in the University of
Oxford‚ over which the Archbishop of Canterbury exercised
high authority. This condemnation, which is dated 18th
March, 1277, occurred a few days after that which Bishop
Stephen Tempier pronounced against the teaching of Paris
(7th, March 1277) when he renewed the sentence of 1270, and
increased the number of errors condemned from thirteen to two
hundred and nineteen.⁵ In 1270 Ξῖ. Thomas was still alive and
