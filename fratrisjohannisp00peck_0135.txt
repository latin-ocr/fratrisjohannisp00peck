CONTRA KILWARDBY 1 17

the defence which he had made of the doctrines taught in the
University of Paris had been so effective, and so penetrated by
profound devotion to the Church‚ that the bishop dared only
attack him covertly. In 1277, however, the Angelic Doctor
had already been dead three years, and his discipleS‚ it appears,
were not able to defend with equa] authority the heritage en-
trusted to them. Thus in the list of erroneous propositions the
bishop did not hesitate to enumerate some drawn in substance
from the works of St. Thomas And Kilwardby‚ though a
Dominican‚ was not behind his colleague of Paris3 he even
showed himself so intolerant, that certain doctors were filled
with amazement, such as Petrus of Confleto, against whom,
according to Denifle, is directed the archiepiscopal letter,
already published by Father Ehrle. Of this letter, now that it
has been mentioned, we may speak here, as no other docu-
ment puts one so closely in touch with the philosophica] con-
troversies of the thirteenth century.

The opponents of the archbishop reproached him with hav-
ing condemned some opinions which were not only in the class
of debateable matterS‚ but in some cases had more reasons in
their favour than against them. And the archbishop excused
himself by declaring that this condemnation was not to be
understood as meaning that the propositions aimed at were
heretical, only that they ought not to be taught, either because
they were false and divorced from good tradition or because
they were harmful and accorded ill with the Catholic saith.
In support of his position the archbishop confined himself to
six principal pointS, but from the letter itself it appears that
the most important errors are the two following 2—-

1. The so-called vegetative, sensitive and intellectual souls
are only one single substance. 2. These so-called souIS, which
may be termed powers or functions of the ‘animas are not
different forms superposed one on the other, but as it were a
single form.1 These were the points of chief disagreement be-
