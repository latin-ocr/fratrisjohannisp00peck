tween the schools of philosophy, inasmuch as the Augustinian
school made a point of distinguishing between the various
kinds of souIS‚ and while in the plant it only admitted one, to the
animal it ascribed two, and to man three, which were kindled
one above the other.1 And the soul itself they held to be a
substance which inhabits the organic body, but not to be a
form of the body. The Bishop of Paris affirmed explicitly in
the seventh article: Quod intellectus non est forma corporis, nisi
sicut nauta navis, nec est perfectio [ἐντελεχεία] essentialis
hominis,

The condemnation pronounced by the Archbishop of Canter-
bury, repudiated at the general chapter of friars preachers at
Milan and at Paris, seems also to have had but small success at

Oxford. Several doctors continued to teach the condemned ⁷

doctrines, persuaded that the archiepiscopal authority over-
stepped its bounds in judging not only in philosophy but also
in logie and grammar. In any case, when Pecham succeeded
Kilwardby in the archiepiscopate of Canterbury, he followed
resolutely in the footsteps of his predecessor, and with trenchant
letters to the Chancellor and doctors of Oxford and even to the
Bishop of Lincoln he made every effort to prevent the rehabili-
tation of the propositions condemned in 1277.

These letters inserted in Pecham’s Register‚ published by
Wilkins and more correctly by Martin, were re-edited in 1889
by Father Ehrle in the Zeitsclerift fiir Kathol. T lieologie, xiii.
172-193. In the first letter addressed, Ioth November, 1284,
dilectis filiis cancellario et magistris ac scholaribus universitatis
oxoniensis, he says he has noticed with sorrow that some persons
in the University of Oxford still continue to hold opiniones quas-
dam erroneas quas recolendae memoriae dominus Robertus . . .
dignoscitur condemnasse. Among these opinions he lays stress
principally on this: in nornine tantum inodo esse formam unam,
from which it would follow that the body of Christ dead is not

materia ; III. privatio est pure nihil ; IV. conversiva generatio animalium est,
sicut elementorum ,· V. vegetativa, sensitiva et intellectiva sunt simul sub-
stantia ; VI. vegetativa, sensitiva, intellectiva sunt una forma simplex.
