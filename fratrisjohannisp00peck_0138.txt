120 PECHAM

trast to brethren of his order, who wished to defend not only this,
but all the other opinions of Brother Thomas contra omnes
viventes homines, No less noteworthy is the letter issued by
Pecham, 1st June, Ι 285, in answer toa controversial work pub-
lished by the friars preachers against the archbishop, a work head-
less at the beginning, because anonymous (quasilatro ex latebris
sagittas proiciens), disgraceful at the end because the author
has the audacity to put himself on a level with the Apostle
Paul, who reproved St. Peter-although the author is not an
apostle, and he, whom he so fiercely attacks, represents for ever
the authority of the Church. In this letter as in the preced-
ing one, Pecham lays great stress on the importance of those
philosophical disputes which arose twenty years previously,
when the Aristoteliam, revolting against the Augustinian tradi-
tion and against the doctorS, chiefly MinoriteS‚ such as Alexander
of Hales and Bonaventura‚ who held tenaciously to it, tried to
subvert with audacious innovations the traditional doctrines de
regulis aeternis et luce incommutabili, de potentiis animae, de
rationibus seminalibus insitis materiae et consimilibus innumeris.1
The struggle was henceforth between the two orders who were
not only profoundly divided on the question of poverty, but
thought so differently on philosophica] doctrines of greater
moment that the one considered as a pernicious error and fatal
to the safety of the Church, what the other considered as an
ingrained truth on which the saith could without injury rest (doc-
trina unius ordinis sit tota pene contraria doctrinae alterius). The
philosophie question on the nature of the soul and on the unity of
form having become a new apple of discord between the two
orderS, one understands how the Church intervened to settle
the· matter. Thus it is explained how in a century or little
more the Church passed from the condemnation of the physical
books of Aristotle to such an astonishing subservience to the
peripatetic doctrines that some of the most controversial, such
as those indicated above-had the unmerited honour of being
promulgated solemnly in the Council of Vienne.
