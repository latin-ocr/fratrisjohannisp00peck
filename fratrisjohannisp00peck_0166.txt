DEFENSIO FRATRUM MENDICANTIUM.
EDITED ΒΥ C. L. KINGSFORD.

THE Defensio Fratrum Mendicantium is preserved in two
manuscripts, viz„ Dd. xiv. 20, in the Cambridge University
Library, where the title, as above, and author's name are added
in a modern hand, and Digrby, 166, in the Bodleian Library, with
a contemporary heading, “ Pecham Archiepiscopus Cant.'' Ἴ

C. = Cambridge Univ. Library, Dd. xiv. 20, ff. 294V0- 29710
is a parchment manuscript (small 4t0) written in double columns,
of the end of the thirteenth or very early part of the fourteenth
century. The greater portion of the volume, ff. 1-2 58, is occu-
pied by a copy of the Summa super libros Sententiarum, by
Peter of Tarentaise, Pope Innocent V. (d. 1276).

D. = Digby, 166, ff: 68ῑΟ - 71V0, also on parchment (small
410), is written in double column5‚ beginning at the head of the
second column in f. 68ῐ0 and ending with eight lines in the first
column of f. 71V0. Mr. F alconer Madan describes the writing
as modelled on English thirteenth century court-hand, but
thinks that it is itself of the early fourteenth century, though
possibly as late as 173 50. The volume consists of a miscellaneous
collection, chiefly of poetry, especially of such pieces as the
Apocalypsis Goliae and other of the poems attributed to Walter
Map. Amongst other articles of interest are on f. 48, Epistola
Ottonis Rectoris Fratrum de Poenitencia on the suppression of
the Order of Sacked Friars 1 in Ι 274, and on f. 71V0 the Dialogus
inter Divitem et Lazarum, by Robert Baston (fl. 1300), who
was prior of the Carmelites at Scarborough.

These two English manuscripts are clearly independent.
Both are frequently corrupt, though fortunately they correct
