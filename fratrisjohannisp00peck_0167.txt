DEFENSIO FRATRUM MENDICANTIUM 149

one another at most points of difficulty, and it is only occa-
sionally that the continental manuscripts which I shall discuss
presently, preserve readings not found in either of the English
ones. A comparison with the continental manuscripts indi-
cates that the greater authority is to be given to C. But C. is
worn in places and difficult to decipher, whilst D.‚ though much
contracted‚ is otherwise well written. Hence for the most part
I have used D. to furnish the foundation of the text here given.
The marginal notes of the persons of the dialogue‚ etc., are not
given in C.

For reasons, which I shall state later, the ascription of the
poem to Pecham is, Ι believe, acceptable. But in a manuscript
at Paris another version of the poem occurs with the title :—-

“ Incipit Altercacio seit disputacio 1 splundi et Religioni& edita
a fratre Guidone de Marchia‚ ordinis Fratrum Minorum, in qua
primo proponit Mundus summo pontifici de religione graviter
conquerendO, cardinales et totam simul Curiam flagitand0‚
dicens O Christi vicarie.'’ 2

This manuscript, which belonged originally to the Domini-
cans of Grenoble, is assigned by M. Delisle to the fourteenth
century. Bale attributed the poem to Guy de la Marche (whom
he regarded wrongly as an Englishman)‚ on the strength of a
manuscript at Queen's College, Oxford. That manuscript
is now phillipps, 3119, at Cheltenham, but the volume in its
present state no longer includes this poem. As Disputatio
Mundi et Religionis the poem appears anonymously in two
manuscripts now in the Bibliotheque Nationale at PariS, whence
M. Haureau edited it under Guy’s name in the Bz'blz‘otlquue de
Z’Ecole des Chartes, xlv. 1-30, in 1884. The first of these
manuscripts—Bibl. Nationale, 7906—is of the fourteenth cen-
tury ; the other, formerly in the library of M. DesnoyerS,
but now Bz'bl. Nationale, Latin 1573 N ouv. Acq.—-is of the
fifteenth century. M. Haureau designated these manuscripts
respectively A. and B.‚ and I have preserved this lettering for
the purpose of the present edition.
