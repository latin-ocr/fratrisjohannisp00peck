150 PECHAM

The poem, as preserved in A. and B„ is much longer than
the version of the two English manuscripts, A. has no less
than 811 lineS‚ and B. has 737 (including six which do not
appear in A.) In C. and D. there are 58011nes1 of regular
rhyming quatrainS. In A. and B. stanzas of five and more
lines are common ; one stanza has as many as nine lines
and one only three. This departure from artistic form is
of itself suggestive of another hand. The internal evidence
of the additions themselves points to a like conclusion. The
harmony of the stanzas is broken by the interpolation of
superfluous lines, and by changes injurious to their rhythm.2
Long passages are inserted, which are sometimes tasteless ex· γ
pansions of themes treated in the shorter version,3 and in other
placeS‚ whilst entirely novel, add little to the force of the argu-
ment.4 Taken as a whole the added lines are both in form and
matter of inferior quality. Ι do not think it is too much to
say that it is the presence of the additionS‚ which justifies M.
Haureau in his criticism of the poem as containing many harsh,
obscure and incorrect verseS‚ intermingled with some that are
easy and pleasing.5 I conclude that it is in the shorter version
of the English manuscripts that we must seek the work of the
original writer.

That the poem was from time to time subjected to revision
is indeed clear from the variations of A. and B. themselves,
As already noticed‚ B. has nearly eighty lines less than A„
and includes a few which do not appear in the other manuscript
at all. Moreover there is a fourth version printed in the works
of St. Bernardin of Siena,6 which contains only 435 lines, This
last version, which I will designate S„ resembles most closely
B„ and includes the six additional lines of that version ; but it
has a few lines which are peculiar‚ a few which are found in A„
but not in B„ and in a few places agrees withC. or D. against

1 In C. 1. 547 is accidentally omitted.

2 The first three stanzas are a sufficient instance.
