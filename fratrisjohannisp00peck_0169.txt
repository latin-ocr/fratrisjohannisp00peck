DEFENSIO FRATRUM MENDICANTIUM 151

A. and Β. The omissions are largely from the additions of A„
but include also 180 lines from the version of C. ancl D. I con-
clude that S. is the latest version, founded on a superior copy
of that contained in B. That St. Bernardin, who was born in
1380 and died in 1450, could not have been the author of the
poem is of course obvious ; but it is possible that he may have
been responsible for this latest version, the omissions in which in-
clude some of the most definitely topica] allusions of the original.1

Of the versions in A. and Β. it seems reasonable to suppose
that B„ which is of the fifteenth century, represents the later
compilation. With textual variations the whole of the poem
as given in C. and D. appears in A„ but seven stanzas are
missing in B. At the same time the opening lines show
that the writer of Β. had used a copy which had followed C„
D. more closely than does A. In these opening lines the anony-
mous A. agrees with Bz'bl. Nat„ 1742, which assigns the poem
to Guy de la Marche.2 If Guy is to be credited with any share
in the poem, it would seem that it must be as the author of the
version preserved in A.

Guy de 13 Marche was an illegitimate son of Hugh XII„
Count of Angouleme, who died in 1270. He was a Franciscan
friar, and on 2 3rd January, 1291, obtained from N icholas IV. a
dispensation for promotion to any dignity in the order save the
generalship, in spite of the defect of his birth. He probably
died about 1 315 3 Bz'bl. Nat., 1742, containS, in addition to the
Disputatio Mundi et Religionis, a ‘⁶ Tractatus fratris Guidonis
de Marchia, ordinis Minorum, de Cicerone disputatore et sorte,
praedicatione et Platone lectore‚'' in thirty-five stanzaS, of which
M. Delisle prints the two first as follows :— 4

Sortes pre consortibus—currit in consorciO.
In equis et curribus—non est dispensacio,
Platonis in manibus—sonat disputacio,

Et de sortis cursibus—magna demonstraciO.

1 As 11. 101-28, 293-300, 521-44 ; of these B. omits 297-300.

2 See p. 149 above. M. Delisle mentions another MS. of the poem in Bibl.
N at„ Latin, 409, Nouv. Acq.‚ f. 64, but without any description to indicate to
which version it belongs (Bibl. de l'Ecole des chartes, lvi. 576).
