Quidquid Plato loquitur—quidquid Plato disputat.
Sortes hic consequitur—et currendo computat.
Quod si bene curritur-Plato sortem reputat.

Si cursus remittitur—Plato sorti imputat.

Whilst these verses do not suggest that Guy was a poet of
any merit, their appearance gives some support to the ascription
to him in the same manuscript of the authorship of the Dispu-
tacz'o Mundi et Relzgrzbmzv. M. Haureau, on the strength of the
allusion to the Templars in l. 294, argued that the poem
was written certainly before 1312, and probably before 1307.
This is no doubt conclusive, but there is nothing in the allusion
which is inconsistent with a much earlier date. The additions
in the version of A. contain no obvious indication of the time
of writing. Those allusions on which any sure argument can
be founded are all comprised in the shorter version of C. and
D. That A„ unlike S. or even R, omits none of them, is no
doubt evidence of its early date. The one variation of A. from
C. and D. which has any direct bearing on this question is
the reading “ Grandimonticos'’ in this same line 294. The
troubles of the order of Grammont were certainly prominent

, in Guy's lifetime; but so they had been throughout a great

part of the thirteenth century.1 It is probable that “Grandi-
monticos'' is the true reading, and “ Grandimanicos,'' a cor-
ruption due to the English scribes, who did not understand an
allusion which was plain enough to their F rench successorS.
We must, therefore, turn to the evidence of the shorter version
of C. and D.; the examination of it will determine how far
Guy is to be credited with more than a secondary claim to the
’ authorship of the poem.

The Defensio Fratrum M endz'cantz'um (by which title we can
conveniently distinguish the shorter version) was manifestly the
work of a F ranciscan and a schoolman. That it was written
during the third quarter of the thirteenth century seems prob-
able for the following reasons. That the date was later than
the death of Peter Martyr in 1252 is shown by lines 25 3- 56 ; it*
is posssible that this stanza may contain an allusion to the
