DEFENSIO FRATRUM MENDICANTIUM 153

Lzse of Peter by Thomas of Lentini, who died in 1277.1 The
reference to the troubles caused by the numerous minor orders
of F riars 2 makes it almost certain that the time of writing was
before the Council of Lyons in 1274, when Gregory X. abol-
ished all but the four great OrderS.3 The mention of the
Gillelmini, who were absorbed in the Augustinians in 1256,
points to the date being at all events not much later. A refer-
ence to the worldliness of the Templars would have been
apposite enough at this time. That the Order of Grammont
might then have incurred a like censure has already been
pointed out3 if, on the other hand, the reading “ Grandimani-
cos ’' is retained the reference must probably be to the Augus-
tinian F riarS, who wore large sleeves from 12 56 to 1274.4
F urthermore, it seems clear that one purpose of the author of
the Defensio was to reply to the objections alleged against the
F riars in the controversy raised by william of St. Amour and
his followers at Paris between 1255 and 1275. Thus it had
been objected that the religious had no right to teach or to
preach.5 That they were bound to employ themselves in
manual labour.6 That for a person to sell his goods and enter
a mendicant order was contrary to scripture, unless he did so
with a view to supporting himself by the work of his own hands ;
because in so doing he despised what God had given him and
exposed himself to needless temptation.7 That to live by alms
was contrary to Christianity.8 That the Friars commended
themselves and their order, and so were guilty of the sin of the
Pharisee.9

All these positive arguments point to 12 5 5-7o as the date
of the original compilation. If that date be accepted Guy de la
Marche, who was then but a boy, cannot have been the author.
Some negative considerations pointing in the same direction
may be adduced. Had the poem been written in the first
