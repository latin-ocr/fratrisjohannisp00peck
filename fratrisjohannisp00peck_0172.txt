154 PECHAM

instance about 1300 one would have expected reference to such
great lights of the Orders as Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas ;
but if the poem was written during their lifetime 1 the omission
is natural. Guy de la Marche might further have been expected
to mention his own patron, the great Franciscan Pope, N icholas
IV. The retention of the stanza attacking the minor orders.
(ll. 297-300) was not unnatural in a version written like that of
A„ about 13003 it was too obscure to remain in B. or §.3 but.
even a writer of 1300 is not likely to have penned it originally.
On the other hand, the Carmelites and Augustinians would
almost certainly have received specific mention in a work which
was composed first at the close of the thirteenth century.

I therefore conclude that Guy de la Marche was not the
author of the poem in its original form. At the same time he
may very possibly be responsible for the longer, but not im-
proved version, preserved in A. That his version should have
been the one which was most circulated in F rance is not un-
natural; it is equally natural that if Pecham was the original
writer the shorter version should be the one found in our two
English manuscripts,

All the indications of date given above suit well with the
period of Pecham's activity as a teacher in the University of
Paris between 1255 and 1270. We know from the T metatus
Pauperi5‚ and from other source5‚ that he had taken part in the
controversy with William of St. Amour. lt was no doubt in
reference thereto that Titelmann in the short biography pre—
fixed to the Liber de §acrosancta Trz'nz'tate, published at Antwerp
in 1530, speaks of Pecham as having fought with beasts at
Paris ln the notes to this volume I have instanced a few
passages in the poem for which parallels are to be found in
other of Pecham's known writings.2 Though these are not in
themselves of a conclusive character they lend support to an
argument based on other grounds, There therefore seems
to be no sufficient reason for rejecting the ascription of the
Defensio Fratrum Mendz'cam‘z'um to Pecham by a hand of the
fourteenth century in ngby‚ 166.

ln view of the foregoing argument the additions of A. have·
