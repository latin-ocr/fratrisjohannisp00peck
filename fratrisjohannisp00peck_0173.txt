DEFENSIO FRATRUM MENDICANTIUM 155

been relegated to the footnotes and the text of the shorter ver-
sion lest as Pecham’s true work.

Pecham puts his Defence of the Mendicant Friars in the
form of a disputation held between Mundus and Religio before
the Roman Curia. Mundus appears and appeals for some
remedy for his cruel wrongS. The Pope bids him speak freely.
Mundus then declares that he had been but as the clay of the
potter rejected at the hands of his Maker, yet by the cross of
Christ he had obtained pardon. Nevertheless ReligiO, and
the F riars beyond 311 otherS‚ scorned and reviled him. They
preached against him, enticed away his childen to their cloisters,
and cared nothing for the grief of parents. It was wrong that
those, who were meant to be rulers of men, should go a begging
in the streets, and no good could come of such evil (2460).

ReligiO, bidden to reply, calls the saints to witness that
Mundus had wandered from the right way. St. John taught
that worldly pride, ambition and lust must end in death ever—
lasting. Mundus was decaying, so could not come of God.
Mundus was so called by antiphrasis; he stank so horribly
that it was wonder that men loved him. Mundus was the place
of scandal, the Tower of Babel, the dwelling of the pelican‚ the
well of Tantalus, the labyrinth of Daedalus. His stench rose
up unto the stars of heaven, and he lay in imminent peril.
Religio sought out the young to save them from sin ς fathers
were glad that their sons should pray for them in God's service.
She was as the Good Samaritan ; but MundUS, like another
ThersiteS‚ rendered only gibes and jeers in return. Religion
had been established by God to regain heaven for men. Her
types were the ark of Noah‚ the cloud in the desert, the tribe of
Levi; she was the apostolic ship that rescued the drowning
(65-148).

That‚ retorts MundUS‚ reminds me of the Publican and the
Pharisee3 but Ι will soon put this boaster to silence. Monks
of old were men of virtue, content to live on roots and dress in
skins. In comparison with them their successors to-day are
but as monkeys I do not deny the merits of the F riarS, Minors
and PreacherS‚ yet I believe that ere long their zeal will grow
