cold. Now of late are come orders to trouble the world, shame-
fully spattered of every hue. I would Ι might see the whole
pack of them drowned (149-180).

same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, I press always to one hope.
Granted that our first patrons excelled uS‚ it does not follow
that we are wholly bad. If Ι was more beautiful in my flower,
