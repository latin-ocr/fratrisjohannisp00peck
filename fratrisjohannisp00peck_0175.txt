DEFENSIO FRATRUM MENDICANTIUM 157

Jacobites, though far superior, will end in treading the broad
road (277—304).

I must allow, says Religio, that there are some bad people
in cloisters, espeeially among the Benedictines. But there are
other excellent orders, which thou dost maintain; these will
have their reward in heaven. All men marvel to hear the blind
discourse on colour, but more to hear thee girding at monks
They keep vigil whilst thou sleepest, and suffer poverty which
thou dost shun (305-324).

I do not know, replies Mundu3‚ that any one supposes there
is no good in the religious life. But Ι maintain that the secular
is better. St. Paul says that the crown is given to him that
striveth: so must we strive in the world. And, again, it is
better to marry than to burn. Christ did not lead a hermit’s
life. If life in the world is more difficult, then also according to
the moralist it must be more virtuouS. Itis more blessed to
give than to receive; pitiable to have to beg your bread from
rich men's tableS, and to seek again what you once resigned.
We are bidden to swear not at all ; therefore the vows of religion
are to be shunned. A man is either fit or unfit for the work of
the cloister 3 if unfit the cloister has no need for him ; if fit he
oversteps the spiritual path. Heaven is to be won by the active
life. F ree-will depends upon liberty3 it is criminal to hinder
men from salvation by the entanglement of ruleS. We are bid-
den to honour our fathers; but this is impossible in a cloister.
The law forbids begging, and poverty brings many to wrong-
doing. The mean is better than the extreme, it is vain piety
which leaves nothing to free-will. It is better wisdom to pre-
serve what may be of assistance. See in what short time your
novices degenerate‚ till their last state is worse than the first.
Why, if you are followers of Christ, do you seek seats of honour
and to be called Rabbi? Why are purses forbidden? Is it
not better like St. Paul to labour with your hands? For these
reasons the orders of friars will not last ; either they will grow
rich, and become like the monks ; or else when human charity
grows cold they will starve (325-416).

The Pope seems to be moved by this argument, but declares
that he cannot pass judgment till he has heard the other side.
