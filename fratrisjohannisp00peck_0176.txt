Then Religio replies at great length. If Mundus thinks so

highly of the strise in which he lives he clearly does not dislike
the occasion for sin which it affordS‚ and deserves no credit for

it. Mundus has misinterpreted the teaching of St. Paul and of
Christ. Since, moreover, it is more difficult to raise up those
that are fallen than it is to give bread, the religious life is the
better. Mundus may think· it piteous to seek again what has
been resigned ; but Christ once resigned the lordship of heaven!
to be a beggar on earth. The argument on swearing is unsound ε
=oaths help not at all, but the vows of religion profit their pro-
fessors. Even if I were unfit, Ι am nearer to the path of salva-
tion in the cloister than Ι should be in the world. By my
‹twofold life, active and contemplative, Ι prepare myself for the
heavenly kingdom. St. Anselm teaches us that a vow which is
taken freely is no restraint on freewill. The cloister does not
bar the way of salvation, but is chosen as the path which leads
to it most quickly. St. Jerome bids us disregard the claims of
kinship, and cheerfully take service under Christ's banner. The
prohibition of begging applies to the slothful‚ but not to the
evangelical friends of God. You say that poverty is dangerous ;
but if it is voluntary it is meritorious, and only when it is un-
welcome does it lack grace. Solomon's desire for a mean state
was due only to a sense of imperfection‚ as his conclusion shows
Your subsequent argument is of force only for the less proficient,
not for the perfect. Apostasy is due to the lust of the flesh ;
>our orders are like the sea, which can suffer no carrion ; what
God has no use for is cast forth. You do not say that our seats
are unlawful: think well, beneath the shadow of our cloaks
truth and holy conversation find a resting place. Purses are
,allowed to weaklings 3 but the true disciples must abandon
purse and scrip and money. Those who are absorbed in con-
stant study should not be compelled to labour with their hands:
what St. Paul could win with ease they have to acquire in pain.
Do not believe that we shall lack: God, who maketh His sun
to rise on the evil and on the good, can provide for His own as He
hath ever done. Now, Holy Father‚ put an end to our disputa->
tion: dismiss these wordy heralds of heresy in shame, that they
may no more stir up the nations to contend in argument against
me (421-556).
