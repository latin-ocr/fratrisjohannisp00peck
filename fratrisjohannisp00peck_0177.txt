DEFENSIO FRATRUM MENDICANTIUM 159

The Pope then passes judgment, declaring that the regular
life is better, and that the Christian must keep himself unspotted
from the world. Let them bear one another’s burdens. Let
the cloister reform the morals of the world, and the world
minister to the needs of the cloister. Whosoever contravenes
our decree shall be condemned without hope of remission, until
he shall have made satisfaction (5 5 7- 580).

Ι hope that even in this short paraphrase there has been
made manifest something of the merit of Pecham⁷s Defence of -
tlze Mendz'cant Frz'am. If his argument lacks the personal in-
trospection, which gives interest to the opening pages of the
Canticum Pauperis, it has a literary force which distinguishes it
from the dull dialectic of his more set controversial treatises. If
through the nature of its subject the poem falls short of the
pathetic grace and religious fervour of the Philomela, its vigor-
ous versification justifies the praise of the author by Trivet as
an excellent writer of poetry. Certainly we can trace in it signs
of that power of dramatic utterance which Pecham's fame as a
lecturer proves that he must have possessed in no common degree.

I have to thank Mr. G. G. Coulton, Mr. A. G. Little and
Mr. R. L. Poole for various helpful suggestions which I have
made use of in the Noites,
